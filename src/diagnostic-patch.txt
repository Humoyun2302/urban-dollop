DIAGNOSTIC STEPS - Test in browser console:

1. Login as barber
2. Check console for: "[FETCH PROFILE] 📋 Database barber RAW DATA:"
3. Look for these fields in the object:
   - address
   - location  
   - google_maps_url
   - working_district

4. If these are NULL or missing → Problem is in DATABASE (not code)
5. If these have values → Check next log

6. Check console for: "[FETCH PROFILE] 🎯 Setting currentUser from Supabase"
7. Check if workplaceAddress and googleMapsUrl have values

8. Click Edit Profile
9. Check console for: "[BARBER PROFILE EDITOR] 🚀 Component mounted with barber prop:"
10. Look at fullBarberObject - does it have workplaceAddress and googleMapsUrl?

11. Type something in the Address field
12. Click Save
13. Check console for: "📋 BarberProfileEditor: Saving profile with fields:"
14. Verify workplaceAddress and googleMapsUrl are in this object

15. Check console for: "[Barber Profile] 📋 RAW database data:"
16. This shows what came BACK from database after save
17. Check if address and google_maps_url are there

IF THE DATA IS IN DATABASE BUT NOT SHOWING IN UI:
- The issue is in BarberProfileEditor not using the prop correctly
- Check formData initialization

IF THE DATA IS NOT IN DATABASE:
- The issue is in the backend save
- Check the backend logs for the PUT request
