Testing console logs to understand the data flow:

1. When user saves profile, App.tsx handleUpdateProfile is called
2. Profile is saved to Supabase database via backend API
3. Profile is re-fetched from database
4. setCurrentUser is called with fresh database values
5. This triggers a prop change in BarberProfileEditor/CustomerProfileEditor
6. useEffect detects prop change and updates formData state
7. Form fields (using formData.name, formData.phone, etc.) display new values

The logs will show us:
- What database returned
- What was set to currentUser state  
- What the profile editor received as props
- What formData was set to
